Note: I set a thrid sleep of 2000 MILLISECONDS in the testEditRecipeTimeout() method inside the RecipeBookTest class knowing i set a class level timeout of 1997 MILLISECONDS to simulate a realword scenario
so most of the time when you run the tests the test will ended successfully but sometime the test my flailed 
I also used the parallel execution to make the tests execution faster
